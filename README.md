# What is this repository?
This repository is the repository for the Web Technologies exam's project, due to Sars-Cov-2 needs. The exam has been translated in a mandatory project to develop during the summer exam session.

# Why is it published?
It is published in order to make recruiters be able to see what I learned in the Web Technologies course. More than the recruiters, I hope that making the repository public I can help other students in their study of this subject at university.

# Which results has been obtained with this project?
This project has been evaluated 27/30 because of the missing use of a transactional system (which is treated in Databases 2 course) instead of a query system.
